                        <value>Cayuga Hall, one of the five residence halls in College-in-the-Woods, opened in 1972. Building traditions include Cayuga Green, when residents get decked out in green to show their building pride during the Woods Olympics, and Cayuga Community Days. Like other residence halls on campus, Cayuga has its own hall government and plenty of activities throughout the year! The faculty master of CIW also maintains an office here.
