It houses about 200 students in suite-style living and, as part of Hinman, has an area-wide focus on Community Service and Leadership. All of the halls in Hinman College are named after New York state governors. In this case, the Roosevelt being honored is Theodore, the 33rd governor of New York state, not Franklin D. — though they were both governor of New York state as well as president of the United States.\n ",
